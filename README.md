# Coins Project
## Sprint 1
### Sprint Goal
Establish your team structure, development workflow, and get hands-on with GitHub collaboration. This sprint is all about learning to work effectively together using real-world software engineering practices.
### Sprint tasks
1. Implement the provided code into the appropriate classes.
2. Create and maintain corresponding test cases.
3. Collaborate across subteams through pull requests and peer reviews.
## Team Setup
1. One team member creates a group and accepts the assignment using the provided course link.
2. The rest of the team (3â€“4 members total) joins the group via the same link.
3. Split into **two subteams**:
   - **Subteam 1: Code Team** â€“ Implements core functionality and features.
   - **Subteam 2: Test Team** â€“ Builds and maintains tests for the features.
4. Subteams will rotate roles in future sprints.

## ðŸ§ª Peer Code Reviews

Code reviews will be done **across subteams**:
- When **Subteam 1** finishes a feature, they submit a **Pull Request (PR)**.
  - A member from **Subteam 2** reviews and approves/requests changes.
- When **Subteam 2** finishes a test suite, they also submit a **PR**.
  - A member from **Subteam 1** handles that review.
This ensures mutual understanding of both the code and test logic.
